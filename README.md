# Task Management System

This is a simple task management system implemented in Python. It allows users to register, log in, add tasks, view tasks, and display statistics. Tasks are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`) and user information is stored in another text file (`user.txt`).

## Features

- User registration: Users can register with a username and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in with their username and password.
- Add tasks: Users can add tasks, including the assigned user, title, description, due date, and completion status.
- View all tasks: Users can view all tasks stored in the system.
- View my tasks: Users can view tasks assigned to them.
- Display statistics: Admin users can display statistics about the number of users and tasks in the system.

## Usage

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to use the system.
